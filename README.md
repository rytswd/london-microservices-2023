## üåÑ About This Repository

This repository holds the supplementary materials for my talk at London
Microservices Meetup September 2023.

- Demo Steps and Details
- References

## üõù About Demo

All the demo steps are provided in [demo.org](demo.org).

### Prerequisites

In order to run through the demo steps, you will need the following tools:

- `kubectl`
- `kustomize`
- `helm`

If you are to use KinD clusters instead of Civo, you will need `kind` as well.
Also, please note that having 3 KinD clusters will require some significant
compute resource on your machine.

### Tools Used

While you may not need all of the tools, the original demo used the following
tools:

- `kubectl`
- `kustomize`
- `helm`
- `k9s`
- `surreal`
- `mirrord`
- `kubectx`
- `civo` (from Civo)

On top of that, there were several completely supplementary tools used:

- Alacritty
- Arc Browser
- Emacs
- Nix

### Troubleshooting


If you found any misbehaviour with the setup, please feel free to create an issue. While I'm not intending to maintain with the latest details here, I still check activities and may be able to help.
